# Detection-of-IOT-Botnet-Attacks
The detection of Botnet attacks on different IOT Devices using various Machine Learning Models.

>The project had preety ambigious results i.e. 100% accuracy in some cases. So, data from 2 completely different sources were used, just to make sure the models were good. Since, the data was completely different, 2 different models were required for this project.

The data for **Model 1(UCI data)** is available on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00442/
Its on Repository of UCI within https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT

The data for **Model 2(CTU13)** is available on https://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html

The data provided in both sources is very huge **(UCI- about 3.1 GB, CTU-13 - about 74 GB extracted)**, so the data used is probably the snip of the original data of a IOT device or a single attack type and a benign traffic data

## Data may not be uploaded yet because the data is in compressed form and is very large. So if data is available, it is probably the snip of the original extracted data
