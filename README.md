# Detection-of-IOT-Botnet-Attacks
The detection of Botnet attacks on different IOT Devices using various Machine Learning Models.

>The project had preety ambigious results i.e. 100% accuracy in some cases. So data from 2 completely different sources were used. Since >the data was completely different 2 different models were required 
The data for **Model 1(UCI data)** is available on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00442/
Its on Repository of UCI within https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT

The data for **Model 2(CTU13)** is available on https://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html

The data is very huge, so the data used is probably the snip of the original data of a IOT device or a single attack type and a benign traffic data
