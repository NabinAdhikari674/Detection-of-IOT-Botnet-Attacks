# Detection-of-IOT-Botnet-Attacks
The detection of Botnet attacks on different IOT Devices using various Machine Learning Models. 
The data is available on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00442/
Its on Repository of UCI within https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT
The data is very huge, so the data used is probably the snip of the original data of a IOT device.
